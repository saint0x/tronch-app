Congrats {{.ClientFirstName}},

{{.UserFirstName}} has initiated an escrow for your project! ðŸŽ‰

Weâ€™re tronch, the escrow service that will be handling payment!
You can rest assured knowing your funds are completely secure and will be released only once the project milestones have been completed to your standards.

The requirements that are set to be programmed into your smart contract are as follows:
{{.Requirements}}

Below, youâ€™ll find two links:

- A secure link to make payment: 

{{.PaymentLink}}

- A link to your collaborative Dashboard, where you will confirm requirements, and check on project updates from a birds-eye view. Weâ€™ll email you as the project status changes:

{{.DashboardLink}}

Next steps would be to head over to the Dashboard, confirm the requirements, make payment, and leave the rest to us!
